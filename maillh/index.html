                <p>Lester Hartnett was born on February 12, 1893 in Westport, Minnesota, the second youngest of the eleven children of John and Mary (O’Gorman) Hartnett, who farmed in the area.  Subsequently, the family relocated to Napoleon in Logan County, North Dakota.
                <p>After completing public school, he attended Valley City State Normal School, where he was active in dramatics, singing, and the men’s literary society.  He earned his diploma in 1914, then took a position as a teacher in Gackle, which was also in Logan County.  He left that position to study dramatics, and for a brief time, was a member of the Coburn Players, a touring company of actors that gave mostly open air performances of Shakespearean plays and other classics on college campuses.
                <p>After his time with the Coburn Players, Hartnett returned to North Dakota and taught school at Hague in Emmons County.  When he registered with the Selective Service System on June 5, 1917, however, he listed himself as unemployed and living in Bismarck, where his parents had moved a few years previously.  He was inducted into the United States Army at the age of twenty-five in Bismarck on March 29, 1918.  He took his training at Camp Dodge in Iowa, and served as part of the 163rd Depot Brigade until April 20, 1918.
            	<p>Hartnett then joined Company C of the 139th Infantry, and served overseas from May 1, 1918 to July 23, 1919, rising to the rank of corporal.  During this time, he took part in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, as well as in defensive sectors at Gerarmer (Alsace) and Grange-le-Comte (Lorraine).  At the close of the war, he was briefly enrolled at the University of Poitiers in France.  He was discharged from the military at Camp Dodge on July 28, 1919.
            	<p>After returning to the United States, Hartnett returned to his career in education.  According to the 1920 census, he was serving as both teacher and administrator for the public school in Springbrook, in Williams County, North Dakota, a position he continued in for several years.
            	<p>Hartnett then chose to continue his education by entering the University of North Dakota in 1924.  He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Expression from Wesley College, a Methodist college affiliated with the university.  He continued his studies, earning a Master of Arts degree at UND, followed by more than a year of advanced work in speech and drama, completed at the University of Minnesota and Yale University.
            	<p>He began teaching at Minot State Teachers College in 1928, where he ultimately rose to the rank of Associate Professor of Speech and Drama and Director of Radio.  In addition to teaching courses, he directed and performed in campus theatrical productions, coached the debate team, and wrote a play entitled “Tales of North Dakota.”
            	<p>On August 2, 1941, Hartnett married Eva Valker, who taught art at MSTC.  Starting in 1947, the couple conducted summer college tours for a number of years, leading students in travels in Canada, Mexico, South America, and Europe as well as throughout the United States.
            	<p>Lester Hartnett retired from teaching in 1962, one year after his wife’s retirement, and was granted the title of professor emeritus in speech and drama.  The two of them planned to continue traveling; they visited East Asia in 1963.  That proved to be the final trip abroad for the couple, as Lester died on August 26, 1965.  When Minot State College planned construction of a new fine arts building in the 1970s, students, faculty, staff, and alumni supported a decision to honor the couple for their contributions to the arts and to the school.  With Eva Hartnett in attendance, Hartnett Hall was dedicated in December, 1976.

                <p class="popuptextback">This project celebrates a rare collection of letters written by Lester Hartnett to his sisters Katherine and Margaret during his service in WWI. Known as Soldier's Mail, the U.S. Army facilitated regular, but censored, communications from WWI soldiers to their families. These rare 100-year old letters are but a small fraction of those sent by servicemen during the war.
                MSU graciously acknowledges Mary Murphy, grand-niece of Lester Hartnett, for her generous donation of these materials.
